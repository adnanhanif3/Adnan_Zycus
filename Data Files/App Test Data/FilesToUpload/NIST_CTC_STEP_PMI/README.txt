The STEP AP203 and AP242 files were generated from the CTC and FTC CAD models from NIST MBE PMI Validation
and Conformance Testing project.  https://go.usa.gov/mGVm

The files have PMI representation and/or presentation.  Use the STEP File Analyzer to view the graphic PMI
and to analyze the semantic PMI.  https://go.usa.gov/yccx

The STEP files are NOT reference files without any errors.  The STEP File Analyzer will report some minor
Syntax Errors.  Other conformance checking software might also indicate that the files have some errors.

Some aspects of the graphic display of the STEP file might not look correct.   

The files have been cleaned of information that might associate them with a particular CAD system.

To test how well your CAD system implements STEP AP242 PMI, download the NIST PMI CAD models, open one of
the models, export an AP242 file with PMI and process it with the STEP File Analyzer.  The STEP File Analyzer
results will indicate how well the AP242 PMI matches the expected PMI in the test case definition.
